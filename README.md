# Currency

Create a page that loads and shows the current currency conversion rates.
-  Design the page yourself or use utility CSS libraries like: Bootstrap or Bulma or Tailwind
 - Use USD as the base currency.
 - Allow the user to enter a currency amount (allow for decimal amounts like 42.12) in USD.
 - Show the converted amount in each of the available currencies.
 - Either update as the user types or include a button that performs the conversion when clicked.
